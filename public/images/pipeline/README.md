# Pipeline Images

Place your pipeline visualization images in this directory.

## Required Images

The following images should be placed in this directory:

1. **btotal_vs_time.png** - Line plot showing B_total over time
   - Generated by: `validate_and_diagnosticsV1.py`
   - Shows magnetic field variation over the measurement period

2. **btotal_hist.png** - Histogram of B_total values
   - Generated by: `validate_and_diagnosticsV1.py`
   - Shows distribution of magnetic field values

3. **scatter_xy_colored.png** - XY scatter plot colored by B_total
   - Generated by: `validate_and_diagnosticsV1.py`
   - Shows spatial distribution of measurements

4. **spike_deltas.png** - Per-sample |ΔB_total| (spike check)
   - Generated by: `validate_and_diagnosticsV1.py`
   - Shows sudden changes between consecutive measurements

5. **heatmap_anomaly.png** - Heatmap (IDW) of local_anomaly
   - Generated by: `interpolate_to_heatmapV1.py`
   - Shows spatial distribution of local magnetic anomalies

## Image Sources

These images are typically generated by the pipeline scripts and can be found in:
- `data/processed/` directory (for diagnostic plots)
- `data/exports/` directory (for heatmaps)

Copy the generated PNG files to this directory with the names listed above.
